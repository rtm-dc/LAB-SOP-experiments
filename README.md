(Due to hosting issues, the version here replaces the previous version that was visible at https://thelab.dc.gov/LAB-SOP-experiments/. The URL tag specified in `index.Rmd` for that instantiation was `url: 'https\://thelab.dc.gov/LAB-SOP-experiments/'`)

## Environment

first page of the book.

2. Make sure all `.Rmd` files to be included are listed in `_bookdown.yml`, in order.
3. Render the book with `bookdown::render_book("index.Rmd")`.
4. (View the compiled `.html` in a browser to check the rendering.)
