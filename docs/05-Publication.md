# Publication

Projects generate a variety of types of publications. These may include

- Pre-analysis plans,
- Final technical reports, 
- Public versions of GitHub repositories, 
- Public versions of data, and
- Peer-reviewed academic journal articles. 

## Authorship in Pre-Analysis Plans

For pre-analysis plans, we ascribe to the three standards of _substantial contribution_, _approval_, and _accountability_ that _Nature_ lays out [here](https://www.nature.com/nature/editorial-policies/authorship).


## Authorship in Academic Articles

For academic papers, we ascribe to the three standards of _substantial contribution_, _approval_, and _accountability_ that _Nature_ lays out [here](https://www.nature.com/nature/editorial-policies/authorship).

## Publishing Data

We strive to post useful replication data to the extent possible in each project. Some examples of our work doing so include projects on the 911 [nurse triage line](https://github.com/thelabdc/FEMS-911NurseTriageLine-Public) and 457b [enrollment](https://github.com/thelabdc/DCHR-457b-Public).

The federal OPRE has some helpful advice for doing so [here](https://www.acf.hhs.gov/opre/report/guide-publishing-research-data-secondary-analysis).
