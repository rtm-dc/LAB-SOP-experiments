# Getting Started with `git` and GitHub

We use the `git` version control system and the GitHub web interface to manage
version control.

To get started, read and take steps 1 through 5 in section 18.2, "Initial set
up", [here](https://r-pkgs.org/git.html). (There is nothing R-specific about
these steps; RStudio provides an interface to get SSH set up so that you don't
have to enter your password every time you make a commit or fetch remote code.)

At The Lab, we

* do not store sensitive data on GitHub.

We have a few template repositories:

* The data science team's current [template](https://github.com/thelabdc/dsProjectTemplate)
* A simple, not-organized-by-project-phase one [here](https://github.com/thelabdc/Template)
* An older (out of date?) [one](https://github.com/thelabdc/LAB-PythonProjectTemplate)
