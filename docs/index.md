# Preface {.unnumbered}

This provides statistical guidance for randomized experiments, observational causal inference, and data analysis conducted at The Lab \@ DC.

The appendices provide examples of some fundamental operations in R and some standards for managing code and workflow. These examples intend to serve as templates that you can copy, alter, and use in your project work.

Please also see our developing data science standard operating [procedures](https://github.com/thelabdc/labDsSops) and, perhaps, our older [wiki](https://github.com/thelabdc/LAB-Wiki/wiki).
